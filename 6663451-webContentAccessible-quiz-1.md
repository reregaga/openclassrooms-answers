# Understand Digital Inclusion

## Question 1
**Sip and puff devices...**
- [x] ...are used as an alternative way to operate a computer.
- [x] ...are used to steer mobility devices.
- [ ] ...cannot be used if a person has a severe mobility disability.
- [ ] ...are a form of alternative output technology.
- [x] ...are a type of switch technology.

_A sip and puff mechanism is a type of switch technology that serves as an alternative input device. It can be used for operating both digital interfaces and mobile devices and often used by individuals with severe mobility impairments._

## Question 2
**You can create a 100% accessible website as long as you diligently follow the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.**
- [ ] True
- [x] False

_There is no such thing as a fully accessible website. The needs of users with disabilities are complex, particularly of those who experience multiple concurrent disabilities. While no set of rules can ensure access to all users, following the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines will make your site accessible to a diverse range of people._

## Question 3
**Perceivable content refers to content that:**
- [ ] Can be perceived through one of the five senses.
- [x] Doesn’t rely on one specific mode of presentation.
- [ ] Is accessible to a screen reader.
- [ ] Can be seen on a page.

_Perceivable content is flexible enough to support different modes of presentation. It can be understood visually, through sound, and by touch. Information cannot be communicated through taste or smell._

## Question 4
**Where within the WCAG 2.0 document should you look to find specific practices that can address WCAG requirements?

Here is a direct link to WCAG 2.0.**
- [ ] The "Guidelines" section under each of the four principles.
- [ ] The "Techniques" section under each guideline.
- [x] The "How to Meet" section under each success criterion.
- [x] The "Techniques and Failures" section under "Understanding" each success criterion.
- [ ] The "Practices" section under each success criterion.

_Both the "Understanding" and "How to Meet" sections for each success criterion contain a list of techniques and failures. The "How to meet" section is more interactive and allows you to filter out results by tags, conformance levels, and other options._

## Question 5
**In the How to Meet WCAG interactive guide, what advisory technique is relevant to visual design and color at level A? 

Tip: use the filtering features to find your answer.**
- [ ] Using a technology that has commonly-available user agents that can change the foreground and background of blocks of text.
- [ ] Ensuring that a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 exists between text (and images of text) and background behind the text.
- [x] Using CSS to change the presentation of a user interface component when it receives focus.
- [ ] Ensuring that information conveyed by color differences is also available in text.

_If you select: Visual Design, Color, Advisory Techniques, and Level A, the tool will filter out all but the following technique: C15: Using CSS to change the presentation of a user interface component when it receives focus._

## Question 6
**Inclusive design…**
- [x] ...takes into account the needs of people with disabilities.
- [x] ...considers the full range of diversity with respect to any form of human difference.
- [x] ...encourages us to question our assumptions about how someone might use a product or service.
- [x] ...often creates better design for everyone.

_All of these statements are true! Inclusive design considers the needs of people with disabilities but goes much further than that. It strives to accommodate the full range of human diversity concerning other forms of difference as well. To create more inclusive products, designers need to continuously question their assumptions about how someone might experience a product or service. In many cases, this has benefits that reach beyond just the immediate needs someone tries to address, having a “curb-cut effect.”_

## Question 7
**Consistency is most relevant to which of the following WCAG principles?**
- [ ] Perceivability
- [ ] Predictability
- [ ] Operability
- [x] Understandability
- [ ] Robustness

_Consistency is most important for supporting the principle of understandability in WCAG. Interfaces that are consistent in their organization and use of interactions are more easily predictable, making them easier to understand. While consistency improves predictability, this is a guideline under WCAG and not one of the overarching principles._

## Question 8
**Why does presenting text as an image create accessibility barriers?**
- [x] Images of text don’t allow users to modify the font.
- [ ] Images of text don’t respond to inverted colors and increased contrast.
- [x] Images of text don’t resize well.
- [x] Text presented as an image can’t be selected.
- [x] Text in images isn’t always communicated to screen reader users.

_Images of text create accessibility barriers in some use cases. It is not possible to change the font if the user requires a distinctive typeface or text with thicker strokes. It also doesn’t resize well because it is rasterized and can become pixelated when zoomed in. While it is still possible to invert the colors within an image or increase the contrast, images of text don’t respond as well to these features. For example, they don’t respond to the iOS smart invert feature, which reverses the colors of content but not of images. This content also isn’t communicated to screen reader users unless it also appears in the alt text description. Finally, some users may want to annotate content or copy it into a document, which is not possible when presented as an image._6663451-webContentAccessible-quiz-1.md
