# Design Accessible Web Content

## Question 1
**What aspects of the Gill Sans typeface (shown below) contribute to its readability? 
Gill Sans typeface. Source: Wikimedia Commons.**
- [x] Open counters and apertures
- [ ] No character ambiguity
- [x] Stroke evenness
- [ ] Character spacing
- [ ] Wide leading

_Open apertures and counters and even strokes make the Gill Sans typeface easier to see and read. One of the biggest downfalls of this typeface is that some of the characters look very similar to one another, so it doesn’t perform well on character ambiguity tests such as the Il1 test. Also, character ambiguity is a contributing factor to legibility, more so than readability. Good character spacing and wide leading do generally result in more readable text, but these are set by the designer and are not characteristics of the typeface itself._

## Question 2
**How could you make the following paragraph more readable? 
Paragraph of text.**
- [ ] Increase line length by 50%.
- [ ] Decrease line length by 50%.
- [ ] Increase line length by 30%.
- [x] Decrease line length by 30%.
- [x] Increase vertical spacing (leading).
- [ ] Decrease vertical spacing (leading).
- [x] Increase font-weight.
- [ ] Decrease font-weight.

_The paragraph can be made more readable by :


Decreasing the line length by 30%, which would result in line length between 40 and 75 characters. 


Increasing vertical spacing (leading) to allow for more negative space between the lines. 


Increasing the font-weight, making the text easier to see, especially on small screens._

## Question 3
**What regions does the following page include?**
- [x] Header
- [ ] Footer
- [x] Navigation
- [x] Main
- [x] Search
- [ ] Form
- [ ] Complimentary

_The page includes a header with a navigation and search region, followed by a second navigation region for breadcrumbs, and then a main region._

## Question 4
**A series of tabs requires which ARIA roles?**
- [x] Tablist
- [x] Tab
- [ ] Tabcontent
- [x] Tabpanel
- [ ] Aria-selected
- [ ] Aria-controls

_Tabs should be enclosed in an element with role=”tablist,” individual tabs should have role=”tab,” and the content of each tab should have role=”tabpanel.” You can find this information in the ARIA spec and authoring practices documents. This pattern also requires an aria-selected attribute to indicate which tab is active, and an aria-controls attribute to establish a programmatic relationship between the tab control and content. However, aria-selected and aria-controls are states and properties._

## Question 5
**What is the most appropriate accessible name for the following interactive icon?**
- [ ] A white circle and white semi-circle on a purple background.
- [ ] Profile icon.
- [x] User profile.
- [ ] An abstracted image of a person.

_The icon is interactive, so its purpose is the most important information that needs to be communicated to users. The image itself does not add any meaningful content._

## Question 6
**Which of the following colors can be used for interactive icons on a white background?**
- [ ] &num;85CFCE
- [x] &num;48296F
- [x] &num;AD2789
- [ ] &num;FBBB73
- [x] &num;5797BA

_The contrast ratio for non-text content should be above 3:1. B, C, and E meet this requirement._

## Question 7
**What is the best approach for communicating information with color?**
- [ ] It’s better to avoid communicating information with color because non-visual users and people with colorblindness cannot perceive differences in color.
- [ ] It’s fine to communicate information with only color, as long as the contrast between the colors is above 4.5:1.
- [x] It’s best to communicate information with color to draw attention, and also include a secondary indicator in case differences in color are imperceptible to users.
- [ ] It’s OK to communicate information with color as long as there are clear instructions that explain how color is used (e.g., form fields marked in red require attention).

_Communicating information with color is great! It can be beneficial for lots of people. Also include a secondary indicator that is perceptible to those who don’t see color, or see it differently. High contrast between colors that have different meanings is a good starting point, but it’s not enough. Providing instructions on how colors are used is also a good idea, but the instructions won’t be helpful for those who can’t perceive the color differences._

## Question 8
**Which of the following non-speech information should you include in closed captions?**
- [ ] [looking sternly]
- [ ] [chewing]
- [x] [tires screeching]
- [x] [music playing softly]

_Include any informative auditory information in your closed captions, including screeching tires, which could communicate the occurrence of an accident, or music that sets the mood. While descriptors that clarify the mood of spoken content, such as ‘speaking sternly,’ are important, visual information does not need to be described in closed captions. Some auditory information isn’t meaningful and can be ignored, such as someone chewing. Although, if someone’s obnoxious chewing created tension between characters in a scene, you might want to include it. In these cases, describe the sound in a way that conveys the mood, such as [chewing loudly]._
