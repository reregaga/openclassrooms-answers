# Identify the Benefits of Bootstrap

## Question 1
**Which of the following factors will impact how a web page is rendered for a user?**
- [x] The device the user is using.
- [x] The browser the user is using.
- [x] The version of the browser the user is using.
- [ ] The alignment of the stars.

_Browsers vary in how well they support web standards such as HTML and CSS. In fact, different versions of the same browser might have variations as well. Different devices have different screen sizes, and mobile devices can be used in two orientations, portrait and landscape._

## Question 2
**True or false? Considering how your page will render on a smartphone will have a significant impact on your users’ experience. Choose the most correct answer.**
- [x] True: web pages are frequently viewed on mobile phones.
- [ ] False: more users have access to computers than to mobile phones.
- [ ] False: users download mobile apps as alternatives when they want to access a web page via mobile devices.

_Today, more than half of all web pages worldwide are viewed on mobile phones._

## Question 3
**What do we mean when we say a web page is “responsive?”**
- [ ] The content responds to the accessibility needs of handicapped users.
- [ ] The page’s media elements respond to user interaction.
- [x] The layout responds dynamically to the size and orientation of different screens.
- [ ] The page has Siri fully integrated, so it responds to vocal commands.

_With the different types of screens available to users, web pages require responsive layouts, or layouts that respond dynamically to the size and orientation of different screens._

## Question 4
**The most efficient way to account for the variations in browsers and devices that will be used to access your website is to:**
- [ ] Learn the details of each of the variations and write code to address each of them.
- [x] Use a front-end library that has been built and tested to account for these variations.
- [ ] Use only the most basic CSS and JavaScript to reduce the chances of your site being incompatible with any particular browser or device.

_Using a front-end library, particularly a popular open-source one, is the most efficient way of making your site compatible with many, if not all, of the different browsers and devices._

## Question 5
**True or false? Bootstrap is the only front-end component library that takes into account the need for responsive design.**
- [ ] True
- [x] False

_A number of front-end component libraries have been developed so you can spend more time on implementing the core designs and functionality of your sites and less time debugging and refactoring. Bootstrap is not the only one, but it is the most popular!_

## Question 6
**The easiest and quickest way to include Bootstrap in your project is to:**
- [ ] Use a supported package manager.
- [x] Link to the minified CSS file hosted on the Bootstrap CDN.
- [ ] Download the compiled files.
- [ ] Compile the source code.

_While all of these are valid options for including Bootstrap in your project, linking to the minified files that are hosted on the Bootstrap CDN is the easiest way to get started._

## Question 7
**To ensure that Bootstrap works as expected, which of the following JavaScript libraries need to be included?**
- [x] jQuery
- [ ] MooTools
- [x] Popper.js
- [ ] Dojo Toolkit

_As well as CSS, some Bootstrap components use JavaScript, in particular the jQuery and popper.js libraries, as well as Bootstrap’s own JavaScript library._

## Question 8
**Which of the following are benefits of Bootstrap?**
- [x] It is open-source.
- [x] The colors are customizable.
- [ ] You don’t need to develop prototypes of your website.
- [x] Resources and support are available in the Bootstrap community.

_Bootstrap saves you time by allowing you to quickly develop prototypes of your websites and web applications so you can focus on the functionality and structure without worrying about implementing the boilerplate for creating a responsive and cross-browser compatible front end._
