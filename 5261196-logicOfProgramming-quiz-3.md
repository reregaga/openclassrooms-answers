# Identifying data types

## Question 1
**Which of the following is true about variables?**
- [x] They are used to store data.
- [ ] They have a name but not a type.
- [ ] They have a type but not a name.
- [x] They have both a name and a type.

_Variables are used to store data.Â  They always have a name and a type.Â  They also have a size._

## Question 2
**Which of these are primitive data types?**
- [x] String
- [x] Boolean
- [x] Null
- [ ] Empty
- [x] Number

_Empty is not a primitive data type, but it is a value._

## Question 3
**Which of these is a string?**
- [x] "The sky is blue."
- [ ] Water is wet.
- [ ] True
- [x] 'eleven'

_Strings are a series of characters. They are surrounded by single or double quotation marks._

## Question 4
**Where are variables stored?**
- [x] In computer memory
- [ ] In the cloud
- [ ] In a warehouse
- [x] In specific, recorded locations

_Variables are stored in a specific location in computer memory.Â  Warehouses are a good analogy for it._

## Question 5
**What is true of arrays?**
- [x] They have a specific size that must be specified when they are created.
- [x] They store groups of data.
- [ ] They can expand to accomodate more data.
- [x] They cannot change their size.

_Arrays are fixed in size and that size cannot be modified once it has been created._

## Question 6
**Which of the following statements are true of lists?**
- [ ] Fixed-size lists are best for when you know how many things you want in your list ahead of time.
- [x] Ordered lists are for things that need to be stored in a specific sequence or order.
- [x] Unordered lists are for items that don't need to be put in a particular order.
- [x] The size of a list can change.
- [ ] You cannot delete items in a list.

_Lists can change to adapt to any size, which includes both getting bigger and smaller. "Fixed-size lists" don't exist; instead, arrays are your best option if you want to hold a fixed number of elements, you know the exact number you need ahead of time, and you're certain this number won't change._

## Question 7
**You want to invite guests to a birthday party. You decide to store their names as data in a computer program.Â You knowÂ that you'll likely need to add the names of some of your friends' partners as well as remove anyone who can't come.Â  Which of the following would be the best suited to your needs?**
- [ ] An array
- [ ] An ordered list
- [x] An unordered list
- [ ] A unicorn ðŸ¦„

_Since you're not sure how many people you will have coming to your party, and you're fairly certain that the number will evolve over time, you should use a list. And, unless you enjoy ranking your guests, an unordered list would be most appropriate._

## Question 8
**What is true of dictionaries?**
- [x] They are also called "maps."
- [x] They are useful for storing information that needs to be looked up again and again.
- [x] Their size can be modified.
- [ ] They can only be used with words.

_Dictionaries can be used to store different kinds of data types._

## Question 9
**What are key/value pairs?**
- [x] They are used in dictionaries (maps) to store data.
- [x] A key is used to look up a corresponding value.
- [ ] A key is the stored information associated with a value.
- [ ] A value is used to look up a corresponding key.
- [x] AÂ value is the stored information associated with a key.

_Keys are used to look up values.Â  These are used in dictionaries._

## Question 10
**Imagine you want to create an address book. You'll use it to store the names of your friends as well as their contact information.Â  Which of the following data types would you use?**
- [ ] An array
- [ ] An ordered list
- [ ] An unordered list
- [x] A dictionary

_Since you would associate the name of a friend with their corresponding contact information, using a dictionary would be idea.Â  A dictionary would also be appropriate since you'll be looking up this information again and again._
